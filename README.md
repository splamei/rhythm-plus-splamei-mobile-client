# What happened to the legacy client?
Due to how the legacy client was writen, it no longer can be used or edited. I'm really sorry for any issues and I wish I could keep the client up but I sadly can't.
# So what now?
The new clients are still available and you can still access them with their modern codebase and system:

- [PC Client](https://github.com/splamei/rplus-pc-client)
- [Mobile Client](https://github.com/splamei/rplus-mobile-client)
